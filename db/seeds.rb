            "After reading this book, I had one of my first pangs of Kindle regret since purchasing the device a little over a year ago. Girls in White Dresses is the type of book that I wish I could drop in the mail to one of my college roommates, with explicit instructions to pass it on to the next lady in our little cluster after finishing."

            "In college, twenty-nine had seemed impossibly old. By now, she'd thought, she'd be married and have kids. But as each year went by, she didn't feel much different than she had before. Time kept going by and she was just here, the same.",
            "The thing is that you don't meet someone until you do ... and the older we get, the harder it is. And maybe not all of us will meet someone."
